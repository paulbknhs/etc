# Environment variables for the primary pmlogger daemon.  See also
# the pmlogger control file and pmlogconf(1) for additional details.
# Also see separate pmlogger_farm configuration for the non-primary
# logger configuration settings, separate to this file.
# Settings defined in this file will override any settings in the
# pmlogger zeroconf file (if present).

# Behaviour regarding listening on external-facing interfaces;
# unset PMLOGGER_LOCAL to allow connections from remote hosts.
# A value of 0 permits remote connections, 1 permits local only.
# PMLOGGER_LOCAL=1

# Max length to which the queue of pending connections may grow
# A value of 5 is the default.
# PMLOGGER_MAXPENDING=5

# Default sampling interval pmlogger uses when no more specific
# interval is requested.  A value of 60 seconds is the default,
# unless pcp-zeroconf is installed then the default is 10 seconds.
# Both pmlogger command line (via control file) and also pmlogger
# configuration file directives will override this value.
# PMLOGGER_INTERVAL=60

# The default behaviour, when pmlogger configuration comes from
# pmlogconf(1), is to regenerate the configuration file and check for
# changes whenever pmlogger is started from pmlogger_check(1).
# If the PMDA configuration is stable, this is not necessary, and
# setting PMLOGGER_CHECK_SKIP_LOGCONF to yes disables the regeneration
# and checking.
# PMLOGGER_CHECK_SKIP_LOGCONF=yes

# By default pmlogger_check(1) will run pmlogger_janitor to check for
# pmlogger(1) badness caused by processes and/or files that were once
# managed from the control files but have become detached from those
# control files.
# Setting PMLOGGER_CHECK_SKIP_JANITOR to yes disables pmlogger_janitor
# and maybe useful for QA or special testing
# PMLOGGER_CHECK_SKIP_JANITOR=yes
