$version=1.1

#$PMCD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=15; export PMCD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT


# === PMIE CONTROL SPECIFICATIONS ===
# 
# Note:	- if multiple pmie instances for the same host, then they MUST use
#	  different log files;
#	- any occurence of LOCALHOSTNAME will be replaced by local hostname;
#       - the default localhost pmie specification is nowadays setup
#         via ${PCP_PMIECONTROL_PATH}.d/local
#	- pmie configuration file search path is "./:$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmie/"
#	  and the working directory ('.') is the dirname of the Log File.
